# RescueIndia-
This is Codefundo++ 2018 project for predicting, preventing and managing natural disasters.
We aim at developing a model to warn people about the possibility of an upcoming natural disaster by gathering data from various trusted news sources and other data sources. As soon as we know a possible disaster might occur, the concerned people and authorities will be made aware of the situation via text messages.

Our model also focusses on devising and keeping a check on the rescue operations to help the sufferers of a disaster get to safety and making sure they have access to food supplies and shelter.  Our prototype will keep a check on the people currently missing, people who need immediate medical help and property lost during the disaster.

Our prototype will allow people stuck in a disaster to share their location using maps and location feature which will be used to make rescue teams aware of shortest routes and plan out rescue operations. We will also be informing them about the power and water cut off scenario via messages. We will try to communicate with the people by collaborating with radio channels and inform the people about the whereabouts of rescue team and other progress via messages. We will be sending the sufferers motivational messages time to time so that they do not give up or lose hope.
With no availability of internet, we plan on developing a local area network so that the people stuck can communicate with each other and the rescue team.

During the times of disaster, we will maintain a check on the food supplies, medicines, efficiency of the evacuation plan and emergency aid supplies. The model will also provide a basic translator to help translate common words of common Indian languages to Hindi/English to ease communication with the rescue team.

Finally, we will have a forum where people can donate to the affected people and their loss of property. We will also have a forum to conduct workshops in all parts of country to spread awareness about such disasters in which again people willing to make a difference can volunteer and contribute.
